
This package contains a number of style files for the British Machine
Vision Conference.  The main files are as follows.

STYLE FILES:

These files must be present in order to successfully process the various
bmvc_*.tex files.

   bmvc2k.cls
   bmvc2k_natbib.sty
   bmvc2k.bst


REVIEW COPY:

For submission of papers for review, the template bmvc_review.tex should be
consulted.  Please also read the text of that template, as it contains
useful information about preparing your submission.


FINAL COPY:

The final copy should be submitted in two forms: A one-page extended
abstract (see bmvc_abstract.tex), and a 10-11 page paper (see
bmvc_final.tex), where the body of the paper (from the bottom of the author list on 
the first page to the beginning of the references) is not more than 9 pages.

MISCELLANEOUS FILES:

bmvc_authorlists.tex
bmvc_authorlists.pdf
   This is a test file which illustrates the various forms in which the
   author lists are to be rendered.

NOTE ABOUT THE EXTENDED ABSTRACTS


As more conferences move to online-only proceedings, conference attendees
often complain that they miss having the physical proceedings as something
to refer to during the conference.  It is not always convenient to open
one's laptop and read the papers, nor is it easy to "flip through" the
proceedings.  For BMVC we hope to give attendees the best of both
worlds by supplying a printed book of extended abstracts, with high-quality
colour printing, as well as the online proceedings.

To achieve this, it is required that all accepted papers are accompanied by
a camera-ready "one-pager" which can be included in the abstract book.
The one-pager is a great opportunity to allow the audience to see the
essence of your paper, encouraging them to attend the talk or visit the
poster.  As an experiment, we propose an example abstract of one of my
previous BMVC papers, which took me less than an hour, and provides, I
believe, a valuable summary of that paper.  It is recommended that the
authors devote some effort to preparing this summary, as it is rather
different than just writing an abstract.  For one thing, equations,
figures, and references are encouraged and useful (see the example
bmvc_abstract.pdf).

The LaTeX templates for the final copy include an option [extendedabs] to
generate the one-pager.  Users of other systems should match the example's
appearance as closely as possible.  Please direct questions about the
abstracts to Andrew Fitzgibbon <awf@microsoft.com>.
